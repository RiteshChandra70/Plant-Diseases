The Plant Disease Checker Website is a machine learning-powered web application designed to help farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts detect diseases in plants quickly and accurately. By using image recognition technology, the app analyzes photos of leaves to identify possible diseases and suggest preventive or corrective measures. Built with modern frameworks such as Python, PyTorch, and Flask, it provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time predictions and reliable results. This project aims to promote early detection and efficient plant care, ultimately improving crop health and productivity.
