The Plant Disease Checker app is a simple web tool that helps you find out if your plants have any diseases, just by looking at a picture of their leaves. All you have to do is upload a photo, and the app uses smart technology to compare it with common plant diseases, giving you quick and easy results. This project was made to help anyone take better care of their plants, whether you’re a farmer or just have a garden at home, by spotting problems early and suggesting ways to keep your plants healthy.
